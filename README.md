# cljfmt

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/weavejester/cljfmt.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/weavejester/cljfmt)

cljfmt is a tool for formatting Clojure code.

It can turn something like this:

```clojure
( let [x 3
    y 4]
  (+ (* x x
  )(* y y)
  ))
```

Into nicely formatted Clojure code like this:

```clojure
(let [x 3
      y 4]
  (+ (* x x) (* y y)))
```

## Installation

The easiest way to get started with cljfmt is to add the lein-cljfmt
plugin to your [Leiningen][] project map:

```clojure
:plugins [[lein-cljfmt "0.1.1"]
```

[leiningen]: https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen

## Usage

To check the formatting of your source files, use:

    lein cljfmt check

If the formatting of any source file is incorrect, a diff will be
supplied showing the problem, and what cljfmt thinks it should be.

If you want to check only a specific file, or several specific files,
you can do that, too:

    lein cljfmt check src/foo/core.clj

Once you've identified formatting issues, you can choose to ignore
them, fix them manually, or let cljfmt fix them with:

    lein cljfmt fix

As with the `check` task, you can choose to fix a specific file:

    lein cljfmt fix src/foo/core.clj

## Configuration

You can configure lein-cljfmt by adding a `:cljfmt` map to your
project:

```clojure
:cljfmt {}
```

cljfmt has several different formatting rules, and these can be
selectively enabled or disabled:

* `:indentation?` -
  true if cljfmt should correct the indentation of your code.
  Defaults to true.
  
* `:remove-surrounding-whitespace?` -
  true if cljfmt should remove whitespace surrounding inner
  forms. This will convert `(  foo  )` to `(foo)`.
  Defaults to true.

* `:insert-missing-whitespace?` -
  true if cljfmt should insert whitespace missing from between
  elements. This will convert `(foo(bar))` to `(foo (bar))`.
  Defaults to true.

* `:file-pattern` -
  determines which files to scan, `#”\.clj[sx]?”` by default.

You can also customize the indentation rules cljfmt uses. Rules are
defined as a map of symbols to vectors:

```clojure
{symbol [& rules]}
```

There are two types of indentation rule, `:inner` and `:block`.

#### Inner rules

An `:inner` rule will apply a constant indentation to all elements at
a fixed depth. So an indent rule:

```clojure
{foo [[:inner 0]]}
```

Will indent all elements inside a `foo` form by two spaces:

```clojure
(foo bar
  baz
  bang)
  ```

While an indent rule like:

```clojure
{foo [[:inner 1]]}
```

Will indent all subforms one level in:

```clojure
(foo bar
 baz
 (bang
   quz
   qoz))
```

#### Block rules

A `:block` rule is a little smarter. This will act like an inner
indent only if there's a line break before a certain number of
arguments, otherwise it acts like a normal list form.

For example, an indent rule:

```clojure
{foo [[:block 0]]}
```

Indents like this, if there are more than 0 arguments on the same line
as the symbol:

```clojure
(foo bar
     baz
     bang)
```

But indents at a constant two spaces otherwise:

```clojure
(foo
  bar
  baz
  bang)
```
