# cljfmt [![Test Status](https://github.com/weavejester/cljfmt/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/weavejester/cljfmt/actions/workflows/test.yml) [![Release Status](https://dl.circleci.com/status-badge/img/gh/weavejester/cljfmt.svg?style=shield)](https://dl.circleci.com/status-badge/redirect/gh/weavejester/cljfmt)

cljfmt is a tool for detecting and fixing formatting errors in
[Clojure][] code.

Its defaults are based on the [Clojure Style Guide][], but it also has
many customization options to suit a particular project or team.

It is not the goal of the project to provide a one-to-one mapping
between a Clojure syntax tree and formatted text; rather the intent is
to correct formatting errors with minimal changes to the existing
structure of the text.

If you want format completely unstructured Clojure code, the [zprint][]
project may be more suitable.

## Breaking Changes in 0.11.x

The `--indents` and `--alias-map` keys have been removed from the CLI,
in favor of using a configuration file instead.

The `:indents` key has been split into `:indents` and `:extra-indents`.
The `:indents` key **replaces** all default indents, while the
`:extra-indents` key will **append** to the default indents.

If you need to retain backward compatibility with an older version of
cljfmt, then you can add the `:legacy/merge-indents?` key to your
configuration:

```edn
{:legacy/merge-indents? true
 :indents {example.core/foo [[:inner 0]]}}
```

This will treat `:indents` as if it were `:extra-indents`. i.e. it is
equivalent to:

```edn
{:extra-indents {example.core/foo [[:inner 0]]}}
```

## Usage

cljfmt integrates with many existing build tools, or can be used as a
library. As an end user, you have the choice of:

### Standalone

The fastest way to run cljfmt is via a precompiled binary. If you're using
Linux or MacOS, you can run the following command to install the binary into
`/usr/local/bin`:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/weavejester/cljfmt/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

You can also run this command to update cljfmt to the latest version.

If you're using Windows, there's a [zipped up binary][] you can download and
extract manually.

To use cljfmt to check for formatting errors in your project, run:

```bash
cljfmt check
```

And to fix those errors:

```bash
cljfmt fix
```

Use `--help` for a list of all the command-line options.

For persistent configuration, you can use a [configuration file][].

[zipped up binary]: https://github.com/weavejester/cljfmt/releases/download/0.15.3/cljfmt-0.15.3-win-amd64.zip
[configuration file]: #configuration

### Clojure Tools

The official Clojure CLI supports installation of thirdparty [tools][].
To install cljfmt as a tool, run:

```bash
clj -Ttools install io.github.weavejester/cljfmt '{:git/tag "0.15.3"}' :as cljfmt
```

To use the tool to check for formatting errors in your project, run:

```bash
clj -Tcljfmt check
```

And to fix those errors:

```bash
clj -Tcljfmt fix
```

[tools]: https://clojure.org/reference/deps_and_cli#tool_install

### Leiningen

[Leiningen][] is a popular Clojure build tool. To use cljfmt with
Leiningen, add the following plugin to your `project.clj` file:

```clojure
:plugins [[dev.weavejester/lein-cljfmt "0.15.3"]]
```

To use the plugin to check code for formatting errors, run:

```bash
lein cljfmt check
```

And to fix those errors:

```bash
lein cljfmt fix
```

To configure it, put a `:cljfmt` key and a map of options in your
project file. See the [configuration][] section for more details.

### Library

cljfmt can be run as a library that formats a string of Clojure code or
recursively checks / fixes paths like the CLI tool.
First, add the dependency:

```edn
{:deps {dev.weavejester/cljfmt {:mvn/version "0.15.3"}}}
```

Then use the library:

#### Checking strings of code:

```clojure
(require '[cljfmt.core :as fmt])

(fmt/reformat-string "(defn sum [x y]\n(+ x y))")
;; => "(defn sum [x y]\n  (+ x y))"
```

To load the configuration for the current directory:

```clojure
(require '[cljfmt.config :as cfg])

(fmt/reformat-string "(+ x\ny)" (cfg/load-config))
;; => "(+ x\n   y)"
```

#### Checking / fixing paths recursively

Be sure to set the report fn to the clojure one as shown below. Otherwise the
`check` and `fix` fns will assume they're running in console mode and will
call `System/exit`, print to stdout, etc.

```clojure
(require '[cljfmt.tool :as fmt]
         '[cljfmt.report :as report])

(fmt/check {:paths ["/path/to/check"], :report report/clojure})
```

Or to recursively fix paths:

```clojure
(require '[cljfmt.tool :as fmt]
         '[cljfmt.report :as report])

(fmt/fix {:paths ["/path/to/fix"], :report report/clojure})
```

### Editor Integration

You can also use cljfmt via your editor. Several Clojure editing
environments have support for cljfmt baked in:

* [Calva](https://github.com/BetterThanTomorrow/calva) (Visual Studio Code)
* [CIDER](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider) (Emacs)
* [clojureVSCode](https://github.com/avli/clojureVSCode) (Visual Studio Code)
* [vim-cljfmt](https://github.com/venantius/vim-cljfmt) (Vim)


## Configuration

In most environments, cljfmt will look for the following configuration
files in the current and parent directories:

* `.cljfmt.edn`
* `.cljfmt.clj`
* `cljfmt.edn`
* `cljfmt.clj`

The configuration file should contain a map of options.

### Leiningen

In Leiningen, the configuration is found in on the `:cljfmt` key in the
project map:

```clojure
:cljfmt {}
```

In order to load the standard configuration file from Leiningen, add the
`:load-config-file?` key to the `:cljfmt` map:

```clojure
:cljfmt {:load-config-file? true}
```

### Formatting Options

* `:alias-map` -
  a map of namespace alias to fully qualified namespace names. May be
  symbols or strings. This option is unnecessary in most cases, because
  cljfmt will parse the `ns` declaration in each file. See [INDENTS.md][].

* `:aligned-forms` -
  a map of symbols to indexes that tell cljfmt where to expect forms it
  should align. For example, `{'let #{0}}` indicates that the first
  argument of let (the binding vector) should be aligned. This option
  will **replace** the default aligned forms. Used by
  `:align-form-columns?`. **Experimental.**

* `:align-form-columns?` -
  true if cljfmt should align the symbols and values within certain
  forms (such as `let`) so that they line up in columns. The forms are
  defined via the `:aligned-forms` and `:extra-aligned-forms` options.
  Defaults to false. **Experimental.**

* `:align-map-columns?` -
  true if cljfmt should align the keys and values of maps such that they
  line up in columns. Defaults to false. **Experimental.**

* `:blank-line-forms` - map of symbols that tell cljfmt which forms are allowed
  to have blank lines inside of them. The value may be either `:all`, which
  means blank lines are allowed between all elements in the form, e.g. `{'cond
  :all}` to allow blank lines between any of the elements inside `cond`; or it
  may be a set of element indexes that are allowed to have blank lines, e.g.
  `{'let #{0}}`, to allow blank lines in the binding of a `let` form. This
  option will **replace** the default blank line forms; use `:extra-blank-line`
  forms to add additional ones. Used by `:remove-blank-lines-in-forms?`.
  **Experimental.**

* `:extra-aligned-forms` -
  the same as `:aligned-forms`, except that this will **append** to the
  default aligned forms. **Experimental.**

* `:extra-blank-line-forms` - the same as `:blank-line-forms`, except that this
  will **append** to the default blank line forms. **Experimental.**

* `:extra-indents` -
  the same as `:indents`, except that this will **append** to the
  default indents.

* `:function-arguments-indentation` -
  - `:community` if cljfmt should follow the [community style recommendation][]
    to indent function/macro arguments by a single space when there
    are no arguments on the same line as the function name.
  - `:cursive` if two spaces should be used instead, unless the first
    thing in the list (not counting metadata) is a data structure
    literal. This should replicate Cursive's default behaviour.
  - `:zprint` if two spaces should be used instead if the first thing
    in the list is a symbol or keyword. This should replicate zprint's
    default behaviour.

  Defaults to `:community`

* `:indent-line-comments?` -
  true if cljfmt should align whole-line `;;` comments with the code.
  Defaults to false.

* `:indentation?` -
  true if cljfmt should correct the indentation of your code.
  Defaults to true.

* `:indents` -
  a map of var symbols to indentation rules, i.e. `{symbol [& rules]}`.
  See [INDENTS.md][] for a complete explanation. This will **replace**
  the default indents.

* `:remove-blank-lines-in-forms?` - whether to remove blank lines inside forms
  per the [community style recommendation][no-blank-lines]. By default, this
  does not remove blank lines in pairwise constructs like `cond` or within
  binding vectors; configure these with `:blank-line-forms` and/or
  `:extra-blank-line-forms`. Defaults to false. **Experimental**.

* `:remove-consecutive-blank-lines?` -
  true if cljfmt should collapse consecutive blank lines. This will
  convert `(foo)\n\n\n(bar)` to `(foo)\n\n(bar)`. Defaults to true.

* `:insert-missing-whitespace?` -
  true if cljfmt should insert whitespace missing from between
  elements. This will convert `(foo(bar))` to `(foo (bar))`.
  Defaults to true.

* `:remove-multiple-non-indenting-spaces?` -
  true if cljfmt should remove multiple non indenting spaces. For
  example, this will convert <code>{:a 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:b 2}</code>
  to `{:a 1 :b 2}`. Defaults to false.

* `:remove-surrounding-whitespace?` -
  true if cljfmt should remove whitespace surrounding inner
  forms. This will convert <code>(&nbsp;&nbsp;foo&nbsp;&nbsp;)</code> to `(foo)`.
  Defaults to true.

* `:remove-trailing-whitespace?` -
  true if cljfmt should remove trailing whitespace in lines. This will
  convert <code>(foo)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n</code> to `(foo)\n`. Defaults to true.

* `:sort-ns-references?` -
  true if cljfmt should alphanumerically sort the requires, imports and
  other references in the `ns` forms at the top of your namespaces.
  Defaults to false.

* `:split-keypairs-over-multiple-lines?` -
  true if cljfmt should break hashmaps onto multiple lines. This will
  convert `{:a 1 :b 2}` to `{:a 1\n:b 2}`. Defaults to false.

### Runtime Options

* `:file-pattern` -
  a regular expression to decide which files to scan. Defaults to
  `#”\.clj[csx]?$”`. **Note:** if your configuration is defined in an
  edn file, you will need to use a string with the `#re` tag. For
  example: `#re "\\.clj[csx]?$"`.

* `:parallel?` -
  true if cljfmt should process files in parallel. Defaults to false.

* `:paths` -
  determines which files and directories to recursively search for
  Clojure files. Defaults to checking `src` and `test`, except in
  Leiningen where the `:source-paths` and `:test-paths` keys are used
  instead.

  Paths can also be passed as command line arguments. If the path is
  `-`, then the input is STDIN, and the output STDOUT.
